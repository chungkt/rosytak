    <p><b><font face="Lucida Calligraphy" size="2" color="#808080">It has been a

    College as the last two years in high school. </font></b></p>

    <img border="0" src="images/universal_studio1.jpg" width="149" height="143" align="left">When 
    we first stepped foot onto the UWC campus in the summer of 1992, all we saw 
    was a construction site, with workers digging and trucks and tractors 
    screaming away. It could well be a coal mine or something, but we were going 
    to start school here in less than two months. Why did I leave the comfort of 
    finishing my last two years of high school at the government school where I 
    had spent 5 years before - I asked myself. </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Lucida Calligraphy" size="2" color="#808080">I had 
    probably my best years, and most fun, at UWC. It was truly amazing to be 
    able to live and study with 200 other students from over 40 countries. And, 
    most importantly, I met Rosy. </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Lucida Calligraphy" size="2" color="#808080">We did not 
    start our relationship until springtime of 1993. When I looked back, I have 
    to say I was a bit amazed at my own &quot;aggressiveness&quot; and &quot;bravery.&quot; Rosy was 
    the first and only girl I ever dated (well, consider that as 100% hit 
    rate!). I never needed to muster up so much &quot;bravery&quot; in my entire life, 
    until I popped the question in February this year. It was a surreal moment, 
    as I asked this question to a person whom I feel comfortable sharing 
    everything with but at that moment it took such c<img border="0" src="images/our_story_4.JPG" width="107" height="103" align="left">ourage 
    to say it. I felt as if I was asking the highest authority to grant me a 
    very important thing, an eternal gift. The adrenaline level in me was 
    probably the highest in ten years. The thing is, I have been looking for 
    this right moment to ask the question the entire week when we were in Paris. 
    It took me quite an effort to carry the ring 7x24 with me the entire week. 
    As the saying goes, the most dangerous place should be the safest. At one 
    point I was thinking of hiding the ring &quot;on&quot; my finger. Of course that 
    wouldn’t work. I am very glad now it is on Rosy’s finger. It has found its 
    home, and so have I. </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Lucida Calligraphy" size="2" color="#808080">The ten years 
    that have passed were not without its ups and downs, as in every 
    relationship. Thin<img border="0" src="images/our_story_3.jpg" width="92" height="93" align="right">gs 
    might have been very different if I had stayed in Hong Kong for college, or 
    come straight back to Hong Kong for work right after college. The six years 
    of &quot;long-distance&quot; relationship allowed us sufficient time and space to know 
    each other, and more importantly, to know ourselves better. We had an 
    opportunity to develop ourselves in different environments before our paths 
    converge. </font></b></p>
    <p><b><font face="Lucida Calligraphy" size="2" color="#808080">Am I 
    rationalizing too much? Maybe I am, as I am always told by Rosy. </font></b>

    <p><b><font face="Lucida Calligraphy" size="2" color="#808080">We are very 
    happy to share our utmost joy and happiness with all of you. It has taken us 
    a while to complete the &quot;due diligence&quot; phase since we signed a &quot;non-binding 
    memorandum of understanding&quot; ten years ago. We are closing this &quot;merger&quot; in 
    several weeks’ time and the signing ceremony will be on November 8. We would 
    like to thank all of you &quot;advisors&quot; who have helped facilitate this 
    &quot;merger,&quot; especially who of you who helped in the &quot;valuation&quot; exercise. All 
    joking (or gibberish) aside, we hope you can join us at our Church Wedding 
    on November 8. </font></b></p>
